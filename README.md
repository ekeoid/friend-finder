# friend-finder

## Overview
In this activity, a compatibility-based "FriendFinder" application was deployed to Heroku. This full-stack site will take in results from a users' survey, and then compare the answers with those from other users. The app will then display the name and picture of the user with the best overall match. Good luck!

You will use Express to handle routing. Make sure you deploy your app to Heroku so other users can fill it out.
